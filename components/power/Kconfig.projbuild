            Defines the threshold (in watts) for high power usage. If the device's total
            power is insufficient to allocate at least 25W to a port, the system will
            prioritize reducing the power allocation on ports with power usage exceeding
            this threshold. This ensures that high-power-consuming ports are reduced first
            to balance the power allocation.

    config MAX_POWER_BUDGET
